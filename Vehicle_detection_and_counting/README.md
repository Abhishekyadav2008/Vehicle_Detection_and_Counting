# Vehicle Detection and Counting System

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV and Streamlit to detect and count vehicles from a video. It draws bounding boxes around vehicles and displays a real-time dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection from video
- Live count tracking
- Streamlit dashboard

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- NumPy

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run detection script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Launch dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Future Scope
- Add vehicle type classification
- Upload new video from dashboard
- Export detection report
